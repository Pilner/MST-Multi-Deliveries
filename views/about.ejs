                <p class="display-2 text-center">Meet the developers</p>
                <p class="h4 mb-4">We are a team of Computer Science students from Polytechnic University of the Philippines who are passionate about solving real-world problems using algorithms and technology. Our team members are Red Meigen Importante, Aldrin Lizardo, Kurt Denver Torreda, and Fabian Railey Victuelles.</p>
                <p class="h4 mb-4">Our project is a web application that uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the optimal routes and minimum number of vehicles for multiple deliveries. Kruskal's algorithm is a graph algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph, which means it can find the most efficient way to connect all the points in a map with the least amount of weight. Our web application allows users to input their delivery points, their warehouse location, then shows them the optimal route for executing those deliveries in as less vehicles as possible. </p>
                <p class="h4 mb-4">By utilizing our website, delivery companies can access a solution that optimizes their operations by identifying the least number of vehicles required and the shortest routes for multiple deliveries. This not only saves them valuable time, money, and resources but also ensures customer satisfaction.</p>
                <p class="h4 mb-4">Join us in our mission to minimize vehicles and maximize deliveries with our innovative map application. Together, we can revolutionize the delivery industry and make a positive impact on businesses and their customers.</p>
